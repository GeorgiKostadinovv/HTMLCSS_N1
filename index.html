    <!--Viewport is the area of web page in which the content is visible to the user.
        This is the common setting of viewport used in various mobile-optimized websites. 
        The width property governs the size of the viewport. 
        It is possible to set it to a specific value (“width=600”) in terms of CSS pixels. 
        Here it is set to a special value(“width= device-width”) which is 
        the width of the device in terms of CSS pixels at a scale of 100%. 
        The initial-scale property governs the zoom level when the page is loaded for the first time. -->
